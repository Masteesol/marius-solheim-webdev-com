    about: `My name is Marius Solheim and I am a front end web development student at Noroff Vocational School. I love programming and web development and I am currently in my second year, due to finish in March 2023. 
    Another passion of mine is music production. I am currently based in Kristiansand, Norway
    `,
    skills: `My current skillset includes HTML and CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, deploying Strapi and using it as a REST API. I have a bit of experience with JS frameworks as React and CSS pre-processors as SCSS. 
    The remainder of my study will focus on frontend frameworks in-depth, so I should have more experience by then. I like to follow the utility-first approach when designing my projects and have made some custom utility functions to aid the workflow.`,
