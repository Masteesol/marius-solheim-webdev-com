    Another passion of mine is music production. I am currently based in Kristiansand, Norway
    `,
    skills: `My current skillset includes HTML and CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, deploying Strapi and using it as a REST API. I have a bit of experience with JS frameworks as React and CSS pre-processors as SCSS. 
    The remainder of my study will focus on frontend frameworks in-depth, so I should have more experience by then. I like to keep my code clean with re-usable utility functions, of which I'll post in the "Posts" section.`
